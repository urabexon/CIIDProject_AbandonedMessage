# CIIDProject_AbandonedMessage ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

This project is part of CIID (Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design) and is designed using a human-centered design approach.  
It is a simulation game that visualizes the psychological dynamics of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and the resulting Cassandra Syndrome, allowing players to experience both perspectives.

## About This Project üõë

This project does **not** aim to discriminate against or promote bias toward any gender, group, or mental health condition.  
It is inspired by personal experiences, the film *Girl, Interrupted* ([Hulu Link](https://www.hulu.jp/girl-interrupted)), and multiple clinical research papers.

The game allows players to explore the psychological toll, emotional miscommunication, and empathy fatigue that arise between:

- üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A person with abandonment anxiety (BPD tendencies, exhibiting clingy/testy behavior)
- üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A person suffering from Cassandra Syndrome (who continues to support but grows emotionally exhausted)

The following questions are posed through gameplay:

- How far can kindness and empathy go in strained relationships?
- What should we do when empathy is no longer enough?
- Are DV or moral harassment always caused by a one-sided ‚Äúvillain‚Äù?

All characters and scenarios are fictional. This game does not seek to generalize or stereotype.  
Rather, it aims to explore the "emotional gray zones" that often go unnoticed and prompt reflection on how we relate to others.

## Objectives üéØ

- Simulate how abandonment anxiety and empathy fatigue can gradually destroy relationships
- Avoid labeling any party as solely the "victim" or the "abuser"
- Highlight that some cases of DV or moral harassment may evolve from emotional exhaustion and codependency
- Help users realize that anyone could end up in such a dynamic, on either side

## How to Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. At the beginning, choose one of two perspectives:
   - üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Abandonment Anxiety side (emotionally dependent/testy character)
   - üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cassandra side (supportive but increasingly drained character)

2. Engage in dialogue-driven gameplay with multiple choice responses.

(*Further development in progress*)

## At the End of the Game üìä

- A summary of how your decisions affected the relationship
- Not "who was at fault", but rather: **‚ÄúWhy did it fall apart?‚Äù**
- Prompts for self-reflection on how you would act in real-life similar situations

## Example Reflection Questions üí¨

Many people in society may have undiagnosed BPD-like tendencies.  
BPD is often misunderstood and underdiagnosed. WHO estimates that BPD is one of the most common personality disorders.  
Given this reality:

- How would you respond to such a person?
- Would you try to advise? Stay close? Listen? Or cut ties to protect yourself?
- What if it were your partner? A friend? A family member? A child?
- Could you keep supporting them forever? Would you feel stressed or emotionally burnt out?
- Should you consult a psychiatrist? But what if that act itself made the other person feel judged and abandoned?
- Is DV/moral harassment always the sole fault of the "abuser"?
- Who is truly morally abusive?
- Could **you** be either of these people?

What actions would **you** take?

## About CIID and Human-Centered Design üß†

This project was developed as an interactive experience exploring **reflection, cognition, and behavior** through the lens of CIID's design philosophy.

### What is CIID? üé®

CIID (Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design) is a globally respected design school based in Denmark.  
It promotes creative problem-solving by merging technology, design, and social issues through hands-on projects.

### What is Human-Centered Design (HCD)? üë•

HCD is at the core of CIID‚Äôs philosophy.  
It is a problem-solving approach that aims to create **meaningful experiences for people** by leveraging empathy, observation, and iterative prototyping.

## Glossary üìñ

### Attachment Theory

Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, explains how early emotional bonds with caregivers influence later emotional regulation and relationships.  
People with anxious attachment styles often fear rejection and display hypersensitivity in relationships.

### Abandonment Anxiety

A psychological condition characterized by intense fear of being rejected or abandoned.  
It often originates in unstable early attachment and affects adult relationships.

### Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

A mental health disorder marked by unstable emotions, self-image, and relationships, and impulsive behaviors.  
Key traits include: fear of abandonment, emotional outbursts, testing behaviors, idealization/devaluation cycles.  
WHO and DSM-5 estimate its prevalence between 1.6‚Äì5.9%, often undiagnosed.

### Prevalence in Young Women

Research suggests that BPD is particularly common among females in their late teens to 20s, influenced by hormonal factors, social pressures, and differing emotional responses.

### Testing Behavior

"Testing" refers to actions used to gauge a partner‚Äôs love or loyalty‚Äîlike asking ‚ÄúDo you really love me?‚Äù repeatedly, ghosting, or acting distant to provoke reassurance.  
Common among those with abandonment anxiety and often leads to friction.

### Cassandra Syndrome

A term (non-clinical) describing emotional burnout, depression, and isolation experienced by those in relationships with emotionally disconnected individuals (often with ASD traits).  
It refers to compassion fatigue and the erosion of one's identity.

### Relationship to DV and Moral Harassment

In some cases, BPD or abandonment anxiety may cause impulsive actions and repeated testing that wear down partners emotionally.  
This emotional erosion may eventually result in DV or moral harassment‚Äînot always from malicious intent, but through emotional exhaustion and systemic dysfunction.

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This game includes emotionally intense themes and potentially distressing content.
- It does **not** intend to diagnose or label mental illness.
- BPD and abandonment anxiety are **common human struggles**, not tools for stigmatization.
- If you feel emotionally overwhelmed during play, please take a break.
